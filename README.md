## Running the program

```bash
yarn # Install dependencies
```

The program is written in Typescript, it would need to be compiled _the first time_ and everytime you make changes. A `compile` and `compile:watch` script have been added to help with that. Open a new terminal windown and run

```bash
yarn compile
# yarn compile:watch # Run this to compile when any change is made.
